    <h1>The Might Could Social Media Manifesto</h1>
    <div>Here is the method, really!!!</div>
    <p>Art and things to think about <span>sometimes</span>.<p> 
    <p> <br> <a href="https://1000manifestos.com/the-might-could-social-media-manifesto/">1.I will make art for myself, not for likes.</a></p>
     
    <p> 2.I will post my art even if I think it’s not that great.</p>
    <p> 3.I will not try to do it all.</p>
    <p> 4.I will sometimes take a break and unplug.</p>
    <p> 5.I will be inspired by, not discouraged by, other art I see.</p>
    <p> 6.I will not measure my value by likes and followers.</p>
    <p> 7.I will measure my value by what I create.</p>
    <p> 8.I will make my art, and share it with the world.</p>

    The art that is made is done for one
    is one that is made to better oneself
    do not make it only for others approval.
    In a way to get better we must try to improve our
    skills by multiple angles and horizons
    trying to make something is not always easy.
    Even the experienced will need to think before they complete a piece.
    To be able to give your best you must rest to find inspiration around you.
    The artworks of others are ones that we must
    see as new ideas and surprises and not comparison for where we should be.
    What we see in what we do must not be done for a rush or for fame
    it is a skill you learned to see if your dream be made.
    We can see what we do by what we make in order to improve and make
    it shine.
    The passions we make can be shared with others to see.
